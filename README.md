Fullstack Real-time Chat App

Professional README for the repository AnshMeshram/fullstack-real-time-chat-app.

Note: I couldn't read all files directly from GitHub (the repo page showed a loading error when I tried). I can still provide a complete, professional README tailored for a typical fullstack real-time chat app that uses a frontend/ and backend/ structure. Replace the placeholder values (PORT numbers, environment variable names, database URIs) with the exact values from your codebase.

Project Overview

A fullstack real-time chat application that supports instant messaging, online presence, and (optionally) persistent message storage. The repo contains two main folders:

frontend/ — client application (likely React).

backend/ — server application (likely Node.js + Express + Socket.IO).

This README contains clear setup instructions, development commands, architecture overview, and common troubleshooting tips.

Tech Stack

Fill in exact versions from the project package.json files.

Frontend: React (Create React App / Vite) — JSX, CSS/Tailwind

Backend: Node.js + Express

Realtime: Socket.IO (server + client)

Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose) — or replace with PostgreSQL if used

Auth: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session-based auth

Build & Tooling: npm / yarn

Features

Real-time one-to-one and group messaging

Online/offline presence indicators

Message persistence (stored in DB)

Typing indicators and read receipts (if implemented)

Authentication (register/login)

Frontend UI for messages, contacts, and chat windows

Architecture

Client (frontend) connects to the backend via HTTP for REST requests (login, register, fetch messages) and opens a Socket.IO connection for realtime events (new message, typing, presence).

Server (backend) exposes REST endpoints and hosts a Socket.IO server. On message events, it validates, persists to DB, and emits to recipient(s).

Database stores users, conversations, and messages.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Node.js (LTS recommended)

npm or yarn

MongoDB instance (local or hosted like MongoDB Atlas)

Environment Variables

Create .env files for both backend and frontend (if needed). Common variables:

backend/.env

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

frontend/.env (if used)

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000

Replace variable names if your project uses different ones.

Install & Run (Development)

Open two terminals — one for backend and one for frontend.

Backend

cd backend
npm install
npm run dev        # or: nodemon index.js / node server.js

Frontend

cd frontend
npm install
npm start          # usually runs on http://localhost:3000

Build & Run (Production)

Frontend build

cd frontend
npm run build

Serve the frontend/build folder with a static server or configure the backend to serve static files (Express app.use(express.static(...))).

Backend start

cd backend
npm run start      # production start command

API Endpoints (example)

Replace with exact routes from your backend code.

POST /api/auth/register — register new user

POST /api/auth/login — user login

GET /api/users — list users / search users

GET /api/conversations — list conversations for current user

GET /api/messages/:conversationId — fetch messages for a conversation

Socket Events (example)

Replace with actual event names used in your code.

Client → Server

connect — built-in

join — join a room (user or conversation)

sendMessage — { conversationId, content }

typing — { conversationId, isTyping }

Server → Client

message — broadcasted when a message is delivered

user-online / user-offline — presence updates

typing — typing indicators

Database Models (High-level)

User: { _id, username, email, passwordHash, avatarUrl, status }

Conversation: { _id, participants: [userId], lastMessage, updatedAt }

Message: { _id, conversationId, senderId, text, createdAt, readBy: [userId] }

Testing

Unit tests (if present): npm test in the relevant package.

Manual tests: Create two browser sessions (or incognito) and verify real-time message flow.

Deployment

Suggested platforms

Backend: Render, Heroku (deprecated for new apps), Railway, DigitalOcean App Platform, or self-hosted VPS

Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, or serve from backend

Database: MongoDB Atlas

Notes

Ensure CORS settings allow your frontend origin (use CLIENT_URL env var).

For production Socket.IO over HTTPS, configure a secure reverse proxy (NGINX) or let the platform handle TLS.
